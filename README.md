# tmodalauncher-PufferPanel-FIX
Due to problems modifying the latest version, I resolved the downloading and launching problem with internal folders on the server (mod and world).
The basic code comes from https://github.com/pufferpanel/templates, I made modifications so that it corresponds to the latest server version and creates a mods and world file directly in the server folder.
